##Instructions

### Running the program on MATLAB
1) Run main.m and 3 figures will appear.
2) Figure 1 is the lines superimposed on the edge image.
3) Figure 2 is the 2D hough with the location of the lines
   marked with a red 'x'.
4) Figure 3 is the rectified image.

### Test with your own image
1) Replace 'image-to-rectify.png' in the root folder with your own image. The image file name must be 'image-to-rectify.png'.

## Image Rectification Process
